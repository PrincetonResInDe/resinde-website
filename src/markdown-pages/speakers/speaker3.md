bio: "David Miller is the Director of the Princeton University Faith & Work Initiative (FWI), a Senior Professional Specialist in Ethics, and a Lecturer. In addition to his research, teaching, and programs, he also serves as an advisor to corporate CEOs and senior executives on ethics, values-based leadership, culture, and the role of faith at work. As a thought leader, many senior executives seek his counsel, and scholars, religious organizations, and the media seek his views. An article in the Wall Street Journal recently featured his work with one global client referring to him as the “on-call ethicist.”"
