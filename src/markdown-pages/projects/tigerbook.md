  <h1>Tigerbook</h1>
  <p class="description">
    Tigerbook is a student directory app where upon looking up a student’s name, users can find information on each student. Just two years prior to our team joining the project, Tigerbook had a major update wiping much of its information on students due to privacy concerns among students. Information such as hometowns, room information, and roommates were among the most popular features that were removed. The current version of Tigerbook houses information such as student ID, photo, major, and residential college.

      In our initial phase, we conducted 8 user interviews and spoke with students about their experience. We jotted down notes and after all the interviews, hopped on a call to organize them: first, each member walked the teammates through their interviews and the findings from it. Then, we began grouping notes together and developed themes. Finally, we placed the points onto a user journey map to contextualize the notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The top use cases by students were:
      <ul>
        <li>Include more Princeton-specific information as engagementn</li>
        <li>Incorporate Opt-in/Opt-out capabilities to balance varying privacy concerns</li>
        <li>An updated design</li>

      We ideated different approaches from a social media approach with friends-only profile visibility to adding interest outside of academics. Each idea had their pros and cons, but we ultimately decided to approach the major use case of Tigerbook as a student resource. This helped shape the pathway we wanted by avoiding the exclusive nature of the social media, friend-reliant idea and remaining centralized on Princeton-specific interests.

      We open the app with a straightforward form that users can easily fill out with information that they’d like to have shown on their profile. No information is "required" to be filled out as the minimum necessary information is provided by default as it is in the current app (class year, major, ID, photo).
    </p>
    <p>
      Another major change was addressing the search capabilities to incorporate the new information. This search bar in our design includes multiple filters to search by and is easily accessible on the side in the search results.
    </p>
    <p>
      How the profile is displayed was also a major design feature. Our design mimics a “prox” which is the student ID card and contains all the default information. As users add more information, the information will appear underneath the card in categories.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also updated the design of the app to feel welcoming and modern – emulating the new approach. Our team member, Sophie Torres ‘21, designed the new logo for Tigerbook!

      Talking to users and conducting surveys really helped verify our ideas and avoid making assumptions about our users!
